```
- Given these two array literals below:

int[] firstArray = {1,2,3,4,5};
int[] secondArray = {6,7,8,9,10};
 
- Multiply the element at index position 3 in the first array by the element at index position 1 in the second array.
- Then divide the result by the element at index 1 in the first array.
- Finally, print out the result.

```

> Question 3
```
- Create an array of your top three musicians, use a while loop to loop through them and print out their names

```

> Question 5

- Create a static method that simply returns the remainder of 118 รท 31 then muliplies it by a double value. Invoke/call it inside main().`
```

> Question 6
``` 
- Write a for-loop that prints every number from 13 - 19 including 19

```

> Question 7
```
- Write a for-loop that prints only odd numbers between 1 and 20
```

> Question 8
```
- Create a variable to store a student's grade then print out the student's grade.
- Next step, use if else and else if statements to account for the following below.
- Test your code by changing the value(s) of the grade variable to see different results.

- if a student's grade is between 90 and 100 then print you got an A
- if a student's grade is between 89 and 80 then print you got a B
- if a student's grade is between 79 and 70 then print you got a C
- if a student's grade is between 69 and 60 then print you got an D
- if a student's grade is  59 and below then print you got an F
```

> Question 9
```
- Perform the following calculations on the array below named arrayOfNumbers.

int[] arrayOfNumbers = {12, 4, 67, 8, 90, 23, 4};

Calculations to perform
- Use a for-loop to print out the sum of all the elements in the array.
- Also print out the average of this array.
```

> Question 10
```
- Create a method that prints numbers starting from 45 - 1.  
- However it should print the following based on the following conditions:


1 - print the word Year, if the number is divisible by 3
2 - print the word Up if the number is divisible by 5
3 - Print the words Year Up if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5
4 - If none of these applies then just print the number (value)

```
